    <h4>Why are snaps good for Rust projects?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to discover and install by millions using the Snap Store or command-line every day.</li>
      <li>Automatically updated to the latest stable version of your app.</li>
      <li>Revert to the previous version if an update fails, preserving data.</li>
	</ul>
You can distribute your apps across Linux using a musl-enabled version of Rust, with all the dependencies satisfied. However, end user discovery and update management remain a challenge. Snaps fill this gap, letting you distribute a Rust app in an app store experience for end users.
    </ul>

<b>summary</b>: A fast CSV command line toolkit written in Rust
<b>description</b>: |
  xsv is a command line program for indexing, 
  slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining CSV 
  files. Commands should be simple, fast and 
  composable:
  - Simple tasks should be easy.
  - Performance trade offs should be exposed 
    in the CLI interface.
  - Composition should not come at the 
    expense of performance.
