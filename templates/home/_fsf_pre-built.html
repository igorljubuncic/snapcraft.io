      <h4>Why are snaps good for pre-built apps?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to discover and install by millions using the Snap Store or command-line every day</li>
        <li>Automatically updated to the latest stable version of your app</li>
        <li>Revert to the previous version if an update fails, preserving data</li>
        <li>Isolation ensures no conflicts between applications</li>
        <li>Identical behaviour across Linux distributions, even with library dependencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Distributing the Linux build of your app as a zip lets you provide one download and set of instructions for all of Linux.
        However, end user discovery and update management remain a challenge.
        Snaps fill this gap, letting you wrap your existing Linux build in an app store experience for end users.
