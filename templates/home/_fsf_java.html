    <h4>Why are snaps good for Java projects?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplify installation instructions, regardless of distribution, to snap install myjavaapp.</li>
      <li>Directly control the delivery of automatic application updates.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>Distributing a Java application for Linux and reaching the widest possible audience is complicated. Typically, the user has to make sure the JRE/SDK version and their environment are configured correctly. When a Linux distribution changes the delivered JRE, this can be problematic for applications. Snapcraft ensures the correct JRE is shipped alongside the application at all times.</p>
