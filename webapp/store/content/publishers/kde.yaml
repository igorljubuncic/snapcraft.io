summary: KDE's vision is a world in which everyone has control over their digital life and enjoys freedom and privacy.
description: |
    <p>Each part of the vision has been carefully chosen to convey our intent & scope:<p>
    <p><strong>A world:</strong> We are not doing this only for ourselves, our friends and family, our employer or customers, and we recognize no geographical barriers to our work. We want to change no less than the world we live in.</p>
    <p><strong>Everyone:</strong> The work should not just be for a small group of people. The fruits of our work should be available to all, without being restricted to materially, educationally or socially privileged people.</p>
    <p><strong>Control:</strong> KDE has always aimed to put people in control. We don't want to hand over control to anybody else. Not to some service providers, not to some hardware vendors, not to governments, not even to KDE. KDE wants to put you in the driver's seat.</p>
    <p><strong>Digital life:</strong> We want to allow people to control every aspect of their digital lives: Hardware, software, data, communication, everything. Of course, there is much more to life than the 'digital' part. While we all want freedom and control in the other parts too, influencing that is beyond KDE's scope, so we limit our vision to 'digital life'.</p>
    <p><strong>Freedom:</strong> We believe that freedom is a prerequisite to true control. Some may feel in control of a proprietary application as long as it obeys their commands, but without the freedom to make changes and share them, they are entirely reliant on the vendor's benevolence for this apparent 'control'.</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> In a world where our privacy is increasingly threatened, we wanted to emphasize its importance. Freedom without the right to privacy is no freedom at all.</p>

With Step you cannot only learn but feel how physics works!\nFeatures:\n\nClassical mechanical simulation in two dimensions\nParticles, springs with damping, gravitational and coulomb forces\nRigid bodies\nCollision detection (currently only discrete) and handling\nSoft (deformable) bodies simulated as user-editable particles-springs system, sound waves\nMolecular dynamics (currently using Lennard-Jones potential): gas and liquid, condensation and evaporation, calculation of macroscopic quantities and their variances\nUnits conversion and expression calculation: you can enter something like '(2 days + 3 hours) * 80 km/h' and it will be accepted as distance value (requires libqalculate)\nErrors calculation and propagation: you can enter values like '1.3 ± 0.2' for any property and errors for all dependent properties will be calculated using statistical formulas\nSolver error estimation: errors introduced by the solver is calculated and added to user-entered errors\nSeveral different solvers: up to 8th order, explicit and implicit, with or without adaptive timestep (most of the solvers require GSL library)\nController tool to easily control properties during simulation (even with custom keyboard shortcuts)\nTools to visualize results: graph, meter, tracer\nContext information for all objects, integrated wikipedia browser\nCollection of example experiments, more can be downloaded with KNewStuff\nIntegrated tutorials\n\n",
